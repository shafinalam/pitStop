MANUAL STEPS TO FIX YOUR .ENV FILE:

1. Edit your .env file and replace all email-related settings with these lines:

```
MAIL_MAILER=log
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="carservice@example.com" 
MAIL_FROM_NAME="Car Service Center"
```

2. Save your .env file

3. Run these commands:
   php artisan config:clear
   php artisan cache:clear
   php artisan serve

4. Now try submitting the appointment form again.

5. To check if emails are being generated, look in storage/logs/laravel.log for 
   entries containing "AppointmentConfirmationMail" or "email" after submitting the form.

This will configure your application to log emails instead of sending them,
which is perfect for testing and development.
